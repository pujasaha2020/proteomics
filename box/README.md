# OAuth 2.0 Authentication Process üîì

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that allows your application to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service. The `oauth2.py` script in this repository handles the OAuth 2.0 flow to authenticate with Box. Upon successful authentication, Box provides an access token and a refresh token. The access token grants temporary access to the Box API, allowing your application to perform actions on behalf of the user. The refresh token can be used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to re-authenticate, ensuring seamless and continuous access.
